### Standalone Package of Pfeature 
Introduction: Pfeature is a standalone software package for computing wide range of protein and peptides features from their amino acid 
sequence.  It has the following five major modules for computing protein features based on; i) Composition, ii) Binary profiles, 
iii) Evolutionary information iv) Structure and v) Pattern.  We have developed number of forms of Pfeature that include: i) A web server 
that uses Pfeature functions via web interface from https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/pfeature/ ; ii) Standalone version of Pfeature; 
iii) Library of python for Pfeature and iv) Python scripts for computing features.

This is a standalone version of Pfeature (executables), we have generate executables of Pfeature that can be executed on different platform. 

Installation
Installation of Pfeature is simple as executables are available for  different operating systems (Windows, Ubuntu, Mac, Fedora, Centos). Following are main steps to install Pfeatures on different operating systems.
Microsoft Windows: 
1.	Download Pfeature_win.zip  from https://github.com/raghavagps/Pfeature/tree/master/exec/PFeature_win.zip
2.	unzip Pfeature_win.zip
3.	change directory to Pfeature_win
4.	Run the command: pfeature_win.exe -i <input_file> -o <output_file> -m <options>
<br>  
On MacOs:
1.	Download Pfeature_mac.zip  from https://github.com/raghavagps/Pfeature/tree/master/exec/PFeature_mac.zip

4.	Run the command: pfeature_centos -i <input_file> -o <output_file> -m <options>
Folders & Files
Following is brief description of folders/files in folder Pfeature_OS.
Data: This folder contain csv files for different parameters required to run Pfeature
example.seq : It is an example input file contain sequence of peptides (one sequence per line) 
example.out: An example output file corresponding to example.seq
Features_Table.pdf : File provides description of features in different columns in output file
lib: contain libraries required for package
pfeature_os : Executable file, where os is operating system like win, mac, ubuntu .
README : This file

Commands for running Pfeature
exec –i <input_file> -o <output_file> -m <options>
where, 
•	exec:  executable depending on the OS (e.g., pfeature_ubuntu, pfeature_mac)                           
•	input_file: file contain sequence of peptides/proteins 
•	output_file:  this is output file generated by Pfeature
•	options:  Pfeature support following options
1 for Composition based feature
2 for Autocorrelation features 
3 for Binary pofile 
4 for all features
For more type exec –-help or exec –h
